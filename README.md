- Run `prepare-venv.sh` first.
- Run `run-valkey.sh` to run a message broker for Celery, nothing works otherwise.
- Open the directory as a project in PyCharm, then in Run Configurations:
  - You can debug `celery-solo` just fine...
  - But `celery-prefork-failure` immediately crashes.
- You can run `enqueue-task.py` to run a Celery task.
